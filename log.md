# 100 Days of Code - Log

## Before the chalange
I found about the 100 Days of Code from a slack channel in Flatiron School where I am doing a Full stack web development bootcamp. I thought this would be a nice cjhallange to take especially with my busy schedule where I sometimes get sidetracked. 1 Hour is not a lot and I am sure I can do it - at least

My planned day one in Sunday March 10, 2019. I shoose that day (2 days away from writing this) because thats Day 1 in my new Year! I will be 47 on March 9!

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
